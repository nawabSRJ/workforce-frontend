Here are the chats :

`
// Srajan : Hi, I’m interested in hiring you for a logo design project. Can you help with that?

// Vaishnavi  : Hello! Yes, I’d be happy to assist you with designing a logo. Can you provide more details on what you're looking for?

// Srajan : Sure! I need a logo for my new tech startup. The name is "Tech Innovations." I’m looking for something modern and sleek, incorporating a blue color palette.

// Vaishnavi  : Sounds great! I can definitely create something that fits that description. When do you need the logo by?

// Srajan : Ideally, I would like it delivered in two weeks, if possible.

// Vaishnavi  : That timeline works. I’ll get started right away. The final deliverables will include the logo in various formats—PNG, JPEG, and vector files.

// Srajan : Perfect! What’s your rate for this project?

// Vaishnavi  : My rate is $500 for the logo design. Does that work for you?

// Srajan : Yes, that sounds good. Can we break the payment into two installments? I’ll pay half upfront and the rest once the final design is approved.

// Vaishnavi  : That works for me. I’ll send you an invoice for the upfront payment. Once I deliver the final design, I’ll send the invoice for the remaining amount.

// Srajan : Great! I look forward to seeing the design. Thanks!

// Vaishnavi  : You're welcome! I’ll keep you updated as I work on the design.
